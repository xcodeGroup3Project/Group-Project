Top 3 App Ideas: 
Fitn3ss, myFinance, PetWalkTracker 
Our group decided that we were most interested in the fitness, finance, and walking trackers. 
There aren't many apps around that track walking miles on an actual map very well in addition to adding pictures which could make it more fun 
and interactive. The finance tracker was another good idea because most of the finance apps don't include everything all in one place. 
It would be nice to see your net worth, stocks, and make a budget all in once place. The fitness app is probably our best idea. 
It seems the most reasonable to accomplish well for our group. It would also be nice to have a fitness app that is more manageable to navigate 
than some of the other fitness apps with everything we want out of a fitness app included in one place. 

Final App: Fitn3ss, the fitness tracker
