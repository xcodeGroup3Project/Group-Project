Group project

Ideas:
chat: chatting with your friends.
fitn3ss: this app can make a list of workouts, meal plans, and recommended exercises.
game store api: app where you can look up games and record what you own.
myFinance: app to plan and track your budget 
PetWalkTracker: app to track miles walked with pet and able to upload pictures thorughout various points of your walk.

Top 3 App Ideas: 
Fitn3ss, myFinance, PetWalkTracker 
Our group decided that we were most interested in the fitness, finance, and walking trackers. There aren't many apps around that track walking miles on an actual map very well in addition to adding pictures which could make it more fun and interactive. The finance tracker was another good idea because most of the finance apps don't include everything all in one place. It would be nice to see your net worth, stocks, and make a budget all in once place. The fitness app is probably our best idea. It seems the most reasonable to accomplish well for our group. It would also be nice to have a fitness app that is more manageable to navigate than some of the other fitness apps with everything we want out of a fitness app included in one place. 

Final App: Fitn3ss, the fitness tracker
